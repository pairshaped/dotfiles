" General vim sanity improvements
" ========================================

" Make 0 go to the first character rather than the beginning
" of the line. When we're programming, we're almost always
" interested in working with text rather than empty space. If
" you want the traditional beginning of line, use ^
nnoremap 0 ^
nnoremap ^ 0

" RSI Prevention - keyboard remaps
" ========================================
" Certain things we do every day as programmers stress
" out our hands. For example, typing underscores and
" dashes are very common, and in position that require
" a lot of hand movement. Vim to the rescue

"When typing a string, your quotes auto complete. Move past the quote
"while still in insert mode by hitting Ctrl-a. Example:
"
" type 'foo<c-a>
"
" the first quote will autoclose so you'll get 'foo' and hitting <c-a> will
" put the cursor right after the quote
